    "pip install rl-opts\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can also opt for cloning the [source repository](https://github.com/gorkamunoz/rl_opts) and executing the following on the parent folder you just cloned the repo:\n",
    "```python\n",

    "We have prepared a series of tutorials to guide you through the most important functionalities of the package. You can find them in the [Tutorials folder](https://github.com/gorkamunoz/rl_opts/tree/master/nbs/tutorials) of the Github repository or in the Tutorials tab of our [webpage](https://gorkamunoz.github.io/rl_opts/), with notebooks that will help you navigate the package as well as reproducing the results of our paper via minimal examples. In particular, we have three tutorials:\n",
